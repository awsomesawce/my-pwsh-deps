# Powershell Deps

Dependencies scripts for powershell scripts.
Scripts that are meant to be sourced in other scripts to add functionality.

This is an attempt to make script writing more modular using DRY principles.

## How to use

Clone the repo into your powershell project using git submodule preferably.

## Future Goals

Reimplement as a module, create `.psm1`, `.psd1` for controlling dependencies.
