# Env Mods

This dir contains scripts that alter the pwsh session environment in some way.

## Files

- `getpsenv.ps1`: Contains a function `getPSEnv` that requests the psenv file
  from the <abbr title="Single Source of Truth">SSOT</abbr>, which in this case is the 
  [my-dotfiles](https://github.com/awsomesawce/my-dotfiles) repository.
